#### Matthew 👨🏽‍💻

My dad gave me a computer in 1997, and my late aunt and uncle helped me start coding. Making things easier and better has been a big part of my life ever since.  
I believe coding skills are essential for everyone — not just for programmers — but for improving every area of life.  
My focus today is on **AI and machine learning** to **increase productivity** and **build solutions that benefit everyone**.

When I open-source projects, it's not just about code.  
I also share business ideas — you'll find them in the **"business"** folder of my projects.  
If you have a team and some marketing resources, you can launch your own business from these ideas — no payment to me is needed.  
I love creating and making the world a better place. 🌎
